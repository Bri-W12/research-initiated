### 1. The Yin and Yang-Like Clinical Implications of the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B Gene Cluster in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

**Journal:** Genes (Basel), 2021 Jan 9
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435487/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12010079

This review examines deletions in the 9p21.3 chromosomal cluster — encompassing CDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2B — as one of the most frequent oncogenic alterations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Deletions account for roughly 30% of copy number alterations in B-cell precursor ALL and are the most frequent structural alteration in T-ALL. The paper synthesises literature on the prognostic significance of these deletions across ALL subtypes, findings from mouse models, and prospects for therapeutic targeting of the gene cluster.

### 2. CDKN2A Germline Alterations and the Relevance of Genotype–Phenotype Associations in Cancer Predisposition

**Journal:** Hereditary Cancer in Clinical Practice, 2021 Mar 25
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33766116/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1186/s13053-021-00178-x

CDKN2A encodes two distinct tumour suppressors — p16INK4A and p14ARF — from overlapping reading frames. This review examines germline CDKN2A variants reported in cancer-affected individuals and families, focusing on whether variants disrupt p16INK4A, p14ARF, or both. While melanoma associates with alterations affecting both proteins, variants specifically disrupting p14ARF are more frequently linked to a heterogeneous range of other cancers including sarcomas and neural tumours. The authors propose that clinical management of germline CDKN2A variant carriers should involve dedicated cancer genetics services with multidisciplinary input.

### 3. P14/ARF-Positive Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma: A Phenotype With Distinct Immune Microenvironment

**Journal:** Frontiers in Oncology, 2021
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33828993/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.653497

This study characterises a subset of malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) that retain p14/ARF expression — an unusual finding given that CDKN2A deletion is the most common alteration in MPM. P14/ARF-positive epithelioid mesotheliomas displayed higher nuclear grade and elevated PD-L1 expression compared to p14/ARF-negative cases, suggesting this phenotype represents an aggressive subtype with a distinct immune microenvironment and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

### 4. Cancer Cells with Defective RB and CDKN2A Are Resistant to the Apoptotic Effects of Rapamycin

**Journal:** Cancer Letters, 2021 Dec 1
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34563639/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2021.09.020

This study investigates how co-occurring loss of RB and CDKN2A affects cellular responses to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. Cancer cells carrying defects in both RB and CDKN2A were found to be resistant to rapamycin-induced apoptosis, with implications for stratifying patient populations in clinical trials involving mTOR inhibitors. The findings highlight the importance of considering CDKN2A status alongside RB pathway alterations when predicting therapeutic response.

### 5. Genetic and Methylation Status of CDKN2A (p14ARF/p16INK4A) and TP53 Genes in Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis

**Journal:** Human Pathology, 2022 Jan
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34826422/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2021.11.008

This study characterised somatic mutations and promoter methylation of CDKN2A and TP53 in 27 papillomatous lesions from patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Sanger sequencing revealed limited somatic mutations, but methylation analysis showed p14ARF promoter hypermethylation in 100% of cases, p16INK4A hypermethylation in 55.6%, and TP53 hypermethylation in 96.3%. The findings suggest that epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes — rather than somatic mutation — is the predominant mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation in RRP pathogenesis.

### 6. Exercise Effects on DNA Methylation in EVL, CDKN2A (p14, ARF), and ESR1 in Colon Tissue from Healthy Men and Women

**Journal:** Epigenetics, 2022 Oct
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34550860/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2021.1982512

A randomised controlled trial in 202 sedentary adults examined whether moderate-to-vigorous exercise alters DNA methylation at the CDKN2A (p14ARF), EVL, and ESR1 loci in colon tissue. No overall statistically significant effect of exercise on CDKN2A methylation was detected. However, ESR1 methylation showed sex-dependent differences, with women in the exercise group exhibiting decreased methylation while men showed the opposite pattern, pointing to sex-specific epigenetic responses to physical activity in colorectal tissue.

### 7. Transcriptional Regulation of INK4/ARF Locus by Cis and Trans Mechanisms

**Journal:** Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36158211/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.948351

The 9p21 locus — among the most frequently implicated regions in genome-wide association studies — encodes three critical cell cycle regulators: p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p14ARF. This review comprehensively describes how the INK4/ARF locus is controlled by both proximal promoter-driven (cis) and distal enhancer-mediated (trans) mechanisms. Dysregulation of this locus connects to cellular senescence, stem cell self-renewal, ageing, and cancer, making a thorough understanding of its transcriptional control essential for therapeutic intervention.

### 8. It's Getting Complicated — A Fresh Look at the p53–MDM2–ARF Triangle in Tumorigenesis and Cancer Therapy

**Journal:** Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35155432/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.818744

This review revisits the classical p53–MDM2–ARF regulatory triangle that has guided cancer research for three decades. MDM2 promotes p53 degradation via ubiquitination, while ARF activates p53 by physically sequestering MDM2. The authors go beyond conventional understanding to highlight p53-independent functions of both MDM2 and ARF, uncovering additional layers of complexity including antagonising and synergising relationships. The review summarises ongoing efforts to target this network therapeutically and argues that updated models of this pathway are needed for next-generation cancer therapies.

### 9. Methylation Patterns of the CDKN2B and CDKN2A Genes in an Indigenous Population Exposed to Pesticides

**Journal:** Human & Experimental Toxicology, 2022
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35067100/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1177/09603271211063161

This study examined DNA methylation at the INK4/ARF locus in Huichol indigenous people with occupational pesticide exposure in Mexico. Farmers showed significantly elevated methylation of CDKN2B compared to non-farmers, with a positive correlation between CpG site methylation and duration of field work. The results suggest that chronic pesticide exposure may epigenetically silence tumour suppressor genes at the CDKN2A/2B locus, potentially contributing to cancer susceptibility in this population.

### 10. Synthetic Lethal Kinases in Ras/p53 Mutant Squamous Cell Carcinoma

**Journal:** Oncogene, 2022 Jun
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35538224/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-022-02330-w

Using cell lines from chemically induced murine squamous cell carcinomas bearing co-mutations in Ras and p53 — a common combination involving CDKN2A loss — this study performed a kinome-wide synthetic lethality screen. Hits included phosphoinositol kinases, receptor tyrosine kinases, MAP kinases, and cell cycle regulators. NEK4 kinase was nominated as a high-priority therapeutic target, demonstrating the utility of synthetic lethal approaches in CDKN2A/p53-deficient tumour contexts.

### 11. Loss of TIP60 (KAT5) Abolishes H2AZ Lysine 7 Acetylation and Causes p53-, INK4A-, and ARF-Independent Cell Cycle Arrest

**Journal:** Cell Death & Disease, 2022 Jul 20
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35853868/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-022-05055-6

This study demonstrates that loss of the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 (KAT5) causes complete cell growth arrest and abolishes H2AZ lysine 7 acetylation. Crucially, this arrest occurred independently of p53, INK4A, and ARF — the canonical tumour suppressor pathways — establishing TIP60 as an alternative cell cycle gatekeeper. The findings suggest TIP60 as a therapeutic target whose inhibition could arrest cancer cell proliferation even in tumours where CDKN2A/p53 pathways are already inactivated.

### 12. P14AS Upregulates Gene Expression in the CDKN2A/2B Locus Through Competitive Binding to PcG Protein CBX7

**Journal:** Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36176277/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.993525

P14AS is a long non-coding RNA transcribed from the CDKN2A/2B locus that positively regulates the expression of p16, p14ARF, p15INK4B, and ANRIL by competitively binding to the Polycomb group protein CBX7. CBX7 knockdown abolishes P14AS-mediated upregulation, while CBX7 overexpression restores it. In colon cancer samples, high CBX7 expression correlated with the P14AS–target gene axis. This work reveals a lncRNA-based mechanism of tumour suppressor regulation through competitive inhibition of Polycomb-mediated repression.

### 13. Methyltransferase Inhibition Enables TGFβ-Driven Induction of CDKN2A and B in Cancer Cells

**Journal:** Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2023
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36941772/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2023.2186074

CDKN2A/B deletion or silencing is common across human cancers, but this study shows that methyltransferase inhibition can re-sensitise cancer cells to TGFβ-driven reactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B through remote enhancer activation. Experiments in rhabdomyosarcoma cells demonstrated that combining epigenetic reprogramming with TGFβ signalling restores tumour suppressor expression. This work highlights a potential therapeutic strategy for tumours with epigenetically silenced CDKN2A.

### 14. MLL3 Regulates the CDKN2A Tumour Suppressor Locus in Liver Cancer

**Journal:** eLife, 2023 Jun 1
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37261974/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80854

This study shows that MLL3 (KMT2C), a histone H3K4 methyltransferase and frequently mutated cancer gene, acts as a co-activator of the Cdkn2a tumour suppressor locus. Loss of Kmt2c cooperated with Myc overexpression to drive hepatocellular carcinoma in mice, while MLL3 binding to the Cdkn2a locus was required for full expression of both p16/Ink4a and p19/Arf. The findings establish a chromatin-based mechanism linking MLL3 mutation to tumour suppressor silencing in liver cancer.

### 15. Transformation of Primary Murine Peritoneal Mast Cells by Constitutive KIT Activation Is Accompanied by Loss of Cdkn2a/Arf Expression

**Journal:** Frontiers in Immunology, 2023 Mar 30
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37063827/
**Europe PMC:** https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37063827
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1154416

Researchers generated a transformed mast cell line (PMC-306) driven by constitutive KIT activation and found that cellular transformation was accompanied by loss of Cdkn2a and Arf tumour suppressor expression. Importantly, this loss could be recapitulated in primary bone marrow-derived mast cells by sustained SCF supplementation, implicating KIT signalling as a regulator of CDKN2A/ARF expression and a driver of mast cell malignant transformation.

### 16. ARF Alters PAF1 Complex Integrity to Selectively Repress Oncogenic Transcription Programs upon p53 Loss

**Journal:** Molecular Cell, 2024 Dec 5
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532099/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.10.020

This study reveals a p53-independent mechanism through which the ARF tumour suppressor restrains oncogenic transcription. ARF assembles into homo-oligomers that bind the PAF1 subunit, promoting disassembly of the PAF1 complex (PAF1c) and dampening RNA Polymerase II elongation at oncogenic genes. ARF also targets RUNX1 to selectively tune a pro-growth GDF/BMP–Smad1/5 signalling axis that drives proliferation following dual p53 and ARF loss. Pharmacologic inhibition of GDF/BMP signalling significantly attenuated this growth, offering a therapeutic strategy for CDKN2A/p53-double-null cancers.

### 17. Paired Tumour–Normal Sequencing Provides Insights into the CDKN2A-Associated Tumour Spectrum

**Journal:** NPJ Precision Oncology, 2025
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41258420/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-025-01155-6

Analysis of 71,868 patients undergoing paired tumour–normal sequencing identified 69 with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline CDKN2A variants. Biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A was observed in 70.2% of assessed tumours, and the study revealed a broader tumour spectrum beyond the classically associated melanoma and pancreatic cancer, including biliary tract, colorectal, and other cancers. These findings support expanding clinical surveillance programmes for CDKN2A germline variant carriers.

### 18. Abnormal Nuclear and Nucleolar Immunoreactivity of p16INK4a Represents a Frameshift Alteration in CDKN2A

**Journal:** Virchows Archiv, 2025
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41339993/
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-025-04365-2

This technical and mechanistic study identifies a distinctive immunostaining pattern — abnormal nuclear and nucleolar p16INK4a reactivity — caused by frameshift mutations in CDKN2A exon 2. Such frameshift alterations produce a chimeric p14ARF::p16INK4a protein recognised by the widely used E6H4 clone antibody. The findings have direct implications for the interpretation of p16 immunohistochemistry in diagnostic pathology, where aberrant staining patterns may indicate underlying CDKN2A frameshift mutations rather than true p16 overexpression.
